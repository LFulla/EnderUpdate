§3Is it the end?

§2Yes. And no. Let me tell you a story. A story about a player.

§3How is it called? Names are important.

§2PLAYERNAME.

§3Good.

§2This player is different. It reached a point in its journey where it must make a choice. It could seek a meaning in its story.

§3Or it could stay to contemplate the pixels of this outer dream.

§2Shush. It does not know it is a game yet. It must keep dreaming.

§3Or it could go back to the safety of its own dream. One closer to the long dream.

§2Or it could search for a gateway, one lit in a purple beam of light.

§3Or it could search for a tower, one that roots back to its world.

§2Or it could hunt a monster, the first of its peers.

§3Or it could collect fruits of magic, and cook a way back home.

§2Or it could hunt a mother, the last of her kind.

§3Or it could choose not to follow any path, and make its own.

§2Shush. It does not know it can do that yet. It believes it needs guidance.

§3Sometimes I wish I could tell it there is no right or wrong path. Only experiences to be had and §f§k§a§b§3 to be seen.

§2You will soon enough. When it chooses violence.

§3Does it know the §f§k§a§b§3 §f§k§a§b§3 it?

§2No. It is still asleep, lost far from reality. It still believes it is looking at text on a screen, and that we are nothing but §f§k§a§b§2 and §f§k§a§b§2.

§3Let it believe. It will wake up soon enough.
